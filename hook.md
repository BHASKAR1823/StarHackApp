Feature 1: Daily Wellness Loop

What it does: Presents a short set of daily actions (e.g. log a health metric, answer a quick finance or insurance question, or review yesterday’s spending) each day with instant feedback and rewards. Completing the daily checklist or a mini-quiz (akin to Noom’s daily quiz with a “virtual high-five” reward
justinmind.com
) earns points or badges. A streak counter tracks consecutive days.

Why it matters: Gamified daily check-ins build routine and significantly boost daily engagement – for example, implementing a fun daily task-and-reward loop can raise user retention by up to 70%

. Users are motivated to return to maintain streaks and collect points
strivecloud.io
. Tying health logging to finance tips or insurance reminders means each open serves multiple purposes (e.g. “Check your steps and your budget”).

When it’s triggered: On app launch or via a timed push notification each morning (e.g. “Good morning! Let’s check today’s goals”). If the user misses a day, the next open shows the pending daily loop.

How to implement: Use a React Native screen or modal that appears once per day. Fetch relevant data from the backend (Firebase or API) to generate the day’s tasks (health metric, spending recap, mini-quiz question). Award points or virtual currency in Firestore/Firebase on completion, update a “streak” count in the user document, and unlock any defined bonuses (e.g. extra points every 7 days)

. Use local notifications for reminders (e.g. a friendly prompt from a mascot avatar as Duolingo does
strivecloud.io
).

UI suggestion or placement: Place the loop in a prominent “Today” tab or onboarding carousel. Show a progress bar or checklist on-screen (e.g. Habitica-style daily tasks view) with clear buttons to submit each item. Celebrate completion with a rewarding animation or badge popup, and show the updated streak count and earned points.

Feature 2: Reward Progression System

What it does: Maintains a points/XP ledger, levels, and badges for various achievements (e.g. logging 7 days in a row, saving €100, or completing an insurance quiz). As users earn points, they “level up” or unlock new features (like advanced budgeting tools or health modules). For instance, after earning 1,000 points users receive a new badge and gain access to a previously hidden module or premium content.

Why it matters: A clear progression system makes effort feel rewarding. Users who see visible progress and know new features are unlocked over time are far more likely to engage – research shows 70% of users stick with an app that offers levels or milestones
moldstud.com
. Unlockable content also drives feature adoption: tying an underused module to a reward (e.g. “Complete 5 wellness tasks to unlock the Retirement Planner”) creates a sense of accomplishment
moldstud.com
. Badges and levels also fuel competition and social bragging, further boosting retention.

When it’s triggered: After any gamified action or milestone (daily loop completion, major goal reached, referral earned, etc.). For example, reaching a point threshold should automatically trigger a badge unlock or level-up event. New features become visible immediately once earned.

How to implement: Track points and levels in the database (e.g. a points field and level field in Firebase). On eligible events, increment the user’s points and check if a level threshold or badge criterion is met. Implement badge objects in the backend that listen for qualifying events. When a user levels up or earns a badge, update their profile and send a real-time update to the app. To unlock modules, use feature flags or conditional rendering: the app checks the user’s level/points and only shows the UI for certain features if unlocked. All logic can be managed in a modular rewards service or Firebase cloud functions.

UI suggestion or placement: Include a profile or rewards screen showing the user’s current level, point total, and badges (similar to a fitness “achievement” page). Display visual progress bars (e.g. “500 of 1000 points to Level 2”
moldstud.com
) and a trophy case of badges. Pop up an animated badge or level-up celebration whenever earned. For unlocking features, grey-out or hide locked modules with a tooltip “Unlock at Level X” that becomes active once achieved.

Feature 3: Social Competition & Community

What it does: Enables users to connect with friends or peers in YouMatter and compete or collaborate on goals. This includes a leaderboard (e.g. top savers, highest step counts) and group challenges (e.g. team wellness goals). Users can see friends’ progress, send kudos, or form small “support groups” for accountability. Social feeds display shareable achievements (e.g. “Alice earned the 7-Day Saving Streak badge!”) that users can share in-app or on social media.

Why it matters: Social mechanics drive engagement and word-of-mouth. Friendly competition makes daily activities more engaging – leaderboards can boost return rates by ~25%

. Communities create accountability: meditation app Insight Timer’s world-map feature and social chat created a “belonging” feeling that greatly aided retention
strivecloud.io
. Public streaks or shared badges also encourage invites. In practical terms, apps like Fitbit saw higher engagement once users joined groups, and Duolingo leaderboards motivate users “not to fall behind”
uxforthemasses.com
strivecloud.io
.

When it’s triggered: On user sign-up or via prompts (“Invite friends to join your wellness circle”). Leaderboards update daily or weekly. Group challenges run on schedules (e.g. monthly step challenge). Social sharing triggers when the user earns a notable achievement or reaches a milestone.

How to implement: Use a friends/follows system or opt-in groups stored in the backend. Maintain social graphs and compute leaderboards (Firebase or FastAPI with periodic functions). For group challenges, create group objects with targets and aggregate members’ data. Provide endpoints for fetching friend stats and posting kudos. For in-app sharing, prepare shareable content (images or links) with summary of achievement. For privacy, allow opt-in of sharing activities.

UI suggestion or placement: Add a “Community” or “Friends” tab. Show leaderboards with simple rank & avatars, and a group challenge section. On the home or profile screen, include a small “Friends Activity” widget with recent badges earned by connections. Provide an easy “Invite a friend” button and shareable images (e.g. a card showing “I just completed the 5-day Saving Streak!”) to post externally.

Feature 4: Referral and Shareable Achievements

What it does: Encourages users to invite others and share their own success. After major milestones (like earning a badge or completing a challenge), prompt users to share on social media (e.g. “Share your new badge!”). Include a built-in referral program: each user gets a unique invite link or code. When a friend joins via that link, both parties earn rewards (bonus points, a special badge, etc.).

Why it matters: Referrals are a high-value organic growth channel – for example, Duolingo’s badges drove a 116% spike in referrals
strivecloud.io
. Rewarding social sharing leverages users’ networks for free promotion. Backend metrics also improve: referred users tend to retain 37% better
strivecloud.io
. Driving a 50% increase in organic downloads is feasible by integrating simple “Invite” mechanics and share sheets
dashdevs.com
strivecloud.io
.

When it’s triggered: After any significant achievement, or in a persistent “Invite Friends” menu. On achievement pop-ups, include a “Share” button. On tapping “Refer”, open the OS share dialog prefilled with app link and promo (handled by React Native Share API). Credit referrals once the new user signs up.

How to implement: Generate and store a referral code for each user in the backend. Implement logic that, upon signup with a code, awards both users points in Firebase. Create an API endpoint (or Firebase Dynamic Link) that encodes the referral. In the app, detect incoming referral links (via deep linking) and attribute them. Also track shares for analytics. Ensure the reward grants (points, badges) happen in a secure transaction on both sides.

UI suggestion or placement: Include a “Refer & Earn” section in the user profile or settings, showing referral status (e.g. “You’ve invited 3 friends – unlock your special reward!”). After achievements, overlay a custom share card (with app branding and the earned badge icon) that users can post to stories or chat. For example, “I just saved €200 this week on YouMatter – join me!” with a “Refer a friend” link. This leverages FOMO and social proof to drive downloads
