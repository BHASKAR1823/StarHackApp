## ÔøΩÔ∏è Tech Stack (The Real One)

### What We're Actually Using

```json
{
  "frontend": "React Native 0.81.4 + Expo Router",
  "backend": "Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Realtime)",
  "ai": "Google Generative AI (Gemini 1.5)",
  "ar": "MediaPipe + Expo Camera",
  "animations": "React Native Reanimated v4.1.1",
  "deployment": "Expo Development Build",
  "testing": "Manual testing on real devices (hackathon style)"
}
```

### Dependencies That Actually Matter
- `@supabase/supabase-js`: Database and auth
- `@google/generative-ai`: AI chat functionality
- `react-native-reanimated`: Smooth 60fps animations
- `expo-camera`: AR pose detection
- `lottie-react-native`: Celebration animations (important for dopamine hits)

## ÔøΩüîå API Specifications (What Actually Works)

### Core Functions (TypeScript Interfaces)

**Note**: We're using Supabase client-side, so these are more like service functions than REST endpoints.

```typescript
// User Registration (works!)
interface SignupData {
  email: string;
  password: string;
  name: string;
  dateOfBirth: string;  
  gender: 'male' | 'female' | 'non-binary' | 'prefer-not-to-say';
  height: number; // cm
  weight: number; // kg
}

// What you get back after signup
interface UserProfile {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  name: string;
  coins: number; // Everyone starts with 100 coins
  level: number; // Calculated from coins/activities
  streaks: { daily: number; weekly: number; monthly: number };
}
```

### Gamification Service (The Fun Stuff)

This is where the magic happens - our `gamificationService.ts` handles all the psychological tricks:

```typescript
// Award coins for activities (with variable rewards for addiction)
async awardCoins(amount: number, reason: string) {
  // Add some randomness - 15-25% variance keeps it interesting
  const variance = 0.15 + Math.random() * 0.1;
  const finalAmount = Math.round(amount * (1 + variance));
  
  // 5% chance of "gold chest" - 3x coins (dopamine hit!)
  if (Math.random() < 0.05) {
    finalAmount *= 3;
  }
  
  return { coins: finalAmount, levelUp: checkLevelUp() };
}

// Level calculation (every 200 coins = 1 level)
calculateLevel(coins: number): number {
  return Math.floor(coins / 200) + 1;
}

// Badge system (we have 15+ different badges)
checkAndAwardBadges(): Badge[] {
  // Early Bird, Week Warrior, Coin Collector, etc.
  // Each one triggers confetti animation üéâ
}
```

### Real Activity Tracking

```typescript
// What happens when you complete AR yoga
interface ARSessionResult {
  poseType: 'plank' | 'cross' | 'warrior';
  duration: number; // seconds
  accuracy: number; // 0-100 based on pose detection
  coinsEarned: number; // 30-150 depending on performance
}

// Insurance challenge completion
interface InsuranceChallengeResult {
  challengeId: string;
  pointsEarned: number;
  premiumReduction: number; // Actual dollar amount saved
  wellnessScoreIncrease: number;
}
```

### Wellness Tracking (AR Yoga Actually Works!)

**The AR Pose Detection Story**: We spent 12 hours getting MediaPipe to work properly. Turns out detecting if someone is doing a plank correctly is harder than it looks, but we nailed it.

```typescript
// AR Yoga Session (this was the hardest part)
interface ARYogaSession {
  poseType: 'plank' | 'cross' | 'warrior'; // We have 3 working poses
  duration: number; // How long they held it
  accuracy: number; // 0-100 based on pose alignment
  realTimeCoaching: boolean; // "Lower your hips!" type feedback
}

// Meditation Sessions (4 different programs)
interface MeditationProgram {
  name: string; // "Morning Calm", "Stress Relief", etc.
  duration: number; // 5, 10, 15 minutes
  backgroundSound: string; // Ocean waves, rain, etc.
  coinsPerMinute: number; // 3-5 coins per minute
}

// Health Metrics Dashboard
interface WellnessMetrics {
  todayStats: {
    activitiesCompleted: number;
    coinsEarned: number;
    streakDays: number;
    wellnessScore: number; // 0-100
  };
  // We simulate step tracking, sleep, water intake
  // Real integration would use HealthKit/Google Fit
}
```

### Insurance Endpoints

```typescript
// GET /api/insurance/policy/{userId}
interface InsurancePolicyResponse {
  currentPremium: number;
  discountPercentage: number;
  potentialSavings: number;
  wellnessScore: number;
  challengesCompleted: number;
  nextMilestone: {
    target: number;
    reward: string;
    progress: number;
  };
}

// POST /api/insurance/challenge/complete
interface CompleteInsuranceChallengeRequest {
  challengeId: string;
  userId: string;
  answers?: any[]; // For quiz challenges
  evidenceData?: any; // For activity challenges
}

interface CompleteInsuranceChallengeResponse {
  success: boolean;
  pointsEarned: number;
  premiumReduction: number;
  wellnessScoreUpdate: number;
  certificateEarned?: string;
  nextChallenge?: InsuranceChallenge;
}
```

### AI Chat Endpoints

```typescript
// POST /api/ai/chat
interface ChatRequest {
  userId: string;
  message: string;
  context: {
    currentActivity?: string;
    healthMetrics?: HealthMetrics;
    mood?: string;
    timeOfDay: 'morning' | 'afternoon' | 'evening' | 'night';
    recentActivities: Activity[];
  };
  conversationHistory: ChatMessage[];
}

interface ChatResponse {
  message: string;
  suggestions?: string[];
  actionItems?: {
    type: 'task' | 'reminder' | 'challenge';
    title: string;
    description: string;
    coins?: number;
  }[];
  mood?: 'supportive' | 'motivational' | 'educational' | 'celebratory';
  followUp?: string;
}
```

## üí∞ Business Case (Why This Makes Sense)

### The Problem We're Solving

**Insurance companies lose money on unhealthy customers.** Customers want lower premiums. It's a win-win that somehow nobody has figured out yet.

#### Market Reality Check
- Insurance companies spend $3.8 trillion annually on claims
- 60% of claims are preventable through lifestyle changes
- Current wellness programs have <10% engagement rates
- People spend 3+ hours daily on phones but <30 minutes on fitness

#### Our Solution in Plain English
1. Make wellness activities actually fun (gamification)
2. Use AR to make home workouts engaging
3. Connect wellness directly to insurance savings
4. Use AI to provide personalized coaching

#### Target Users (Who We Built This For)
- **Primary**: Working professionals 25-45 who have health insurance and smartphones
- **Secondary**: Corporate HR departments looking for employee wellness solutions  
- **Dream Scenario**: Insurance companies who want to reduce claims

### How We'd Make Money (Post-Hackathon)

#### Revenue Streams That Actually Work
1. **Freemium Model**: Free basic features, $9.99/month for premium
2. **Insurance Partnerships**: Revenue share on premium savings generated
3. **Corporate Wellness**: $5-15 per employee per month for companies
4. **Data Insights**: Anonymized wellness trends sold to health companies

#### Realistic Subscription Pricing
```typescript
interface PricingStrategy {
  free: {
    price: '$0/month';
    features: ['3 AR sessions/day', 'Basic meditation', 'Simple challenges'];
    hook: 'Get people addicted to the gamification';
  };
  
  premium: {
    price: '$9.99/month'; // Less than Netflix
    features: ['Unlimited everything', 'AI coaching', 'Premium content'];
    value: 'Saves more than cost through insurance discounts';
  };
  
  corporate: {
    price: '$5/employee/month'; // Cheaper than gym memberships  
    features: ['Team challenges', 'Analytics dashboard', 'HR integration'];
    roi: 'Reduced healthcare costs + higher productivity';
  };
}
```

#### The Insurance Partnership Goldmine
- Partner with insurance companies as official wellness platform
- Take 10-20% of premium savings generated
- Insurance company saves money, users save money, we make money
- Market size: 250M+ insured Americans

#### Revenue Projections (Conservative Estimates)

| Year | Users | Paying Users | Monthly Revenue | Annual Revenue | Notes |
|------|-------|-------------|----------------|----------------|--------|
| 1    | 5K    | 750         | $7.5K         | $90K          | Bootstrap phase |
| 2    | 25K   | 5K          | $50K          | $600K         | First insurance partner |
| 3    | 100K  | 25K         | $250K         | $3M           | Multi-platform launch |
| 4    | 300K  | 90K         | $900K         | $10.8M        | Corporate partnerships |
| 5    | 750K  | 225K        | $2.25M        | $27M          | Market leadership |

**Reality Check**: These numbers assume we nail product-market fit and execute well. Plenty of wellness apps fail, but the insurance angle is our differentiator.

#### Insurance Partnership Revenue
```typescript
interface InsuranceRevenue {
  commissionPerPolicy: 50; // $50 per policy sold
  premiumReductionFee: 0.02; // 2% of savings generated
  corporatePartnerships: 25000; // $25K per corporate partnership
  dataInsights: 10000; // $10K per anonymized dataset license
}
```

## üéØ Demo Instructions

### How to Run Our App (For Judges)

1. **Prerequisites**: 
   - Install Expo Go app on your phone
   - Make sure you're on the same WiFi network as our laptop

2. **Launch**: 
   - We'll run `npm start` and show you the QR code
   - Scan it with Expo Go
   - App should load in 10-15 seconds

3. **Demo Flow**:
   - **Sign up** with fake email (or use our demo account)
   - **Try AR Yoga** - we'll show you the plank and cross poses
   - **Chat with AI** - ask it about wellness tips
   - **Check Insurance** - see how activities reduce your "premium"  
   - **View Dashboard** - see all your progress and coins

### What Works vs What's Demo-Only

#### ‚úÖ **Actually Functional**:
- AR pose detection (plank, cross pose, warrior)
- Gamification system (coins, levels, badges)
- AI wellness chat (Google Gemini)
- Insurance calculator (shows real savings math)
- All animations and UI interactions

#### üé≠ **Demo/Mock Data**:
- User profiles (we have ~10 fake users)
- Health metrics (simulated step counts, sleep data)
- Insurance partnerships (we don't have real insurance APIs)
- Payment processing (no actual billing)

### Technical Highlights for Judges

1. **AR Technology**: Real-time pose detection using MediaPipe
2. **AI Integration**: Context-aware wellness coaching via Google Gemini  
3. **Gamification**: Variable reward psychology to drive engagement
4. **Insurance Math**: Actual premium reduction calculations
5. **Cross-Platform**: Works on iOS, Android, and web

## üèÜ Hackathon Reflection

**What We're Proud Of**: 
- Built a fully functional AR wellness app in 48 hours
- Integrated multiple complex technologies (AI, AR, database, animations)
- Created something that could actually save people money on insurance
- The UI doesn't look like we built it at 4AM (even though we did)

**What We'd Do Differently**:
- Start with simpler AR poses (we wasted 8 hours on complex yoga poses)
- Set up the database schema earlier (we redesigned it 3 times)
- More user testing (we only tested with ourselves until day 2)
- Better time management (spent too long on animations, not enough on onboarding)

**The Insurance Angle**:
This isn't just another fitness app. The insurance integration creates real financial incentive for users to stay healthy, which could actually change behavior at scale.

*P.S. - The app works best in good lighting for AR features. If the pose detection seems off, try moving to a brighter room.*
